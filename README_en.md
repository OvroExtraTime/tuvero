# Tuvero 1.5.1

## Description

Tuvero is a browser-based tournament management software, which supports offline-usage. It's directly accessible at <https://tuvero.de>.

There's different variants of Tuvero for different games:

* [Tuvero Boule](https://tuvero.de/boule) for Petanque tournaments (<http://petanque-ost.de>)
* [Tuvero TAC](https://tuvero.de/tac) for TAC tournaments (<http://spiel-tac.de>)

## Usage

### Without Installation

Tuvero is principally installation-free. After visiting <https://tuvero.de> and opening a wanted variant, it's available for offline use.

### Local Installation

Download an installation package from <https://github.com/elor/tuvero>, unpack it and open index.html in a modern web browser.

### Installation on another webserver

As the author of this software, I'd prefer if users would be pointed to <https://tuvero.de> instead of maintaining a separate installation.

However, Tuvero can be installed on another webserver or under a different domain.
In this case, I'd like you to adjust the version number in such a way that confusion with an official release is avoided.
For this task, the development version provides `apply-version.sh`.
See section Build Process, too.
Additionally, I'd be happy to see rapid updates of Tuvero to provide users with the most stable version.

## Build Process

Tuvero can be used without compilation, but is composed of several hundred files, which slow the software down.
To compile Tuvero from the source code, the following steps have to be performed:

    ./build-tools/apply-version.sh {myversion}
    make update    # create all autogenerated files. Necessary after changes to code, images or templates
    make all       # compresses all build targets to ~6 files (from several hundred!)

Afterwards, the compiled files are located inside the build directories (e.g. `boule-build/`), `index.html` and `manifest.appcache`.

## Tests

Open `test/index.html` or `test-build/index.html` in a browser for a list of manual and automated tests of Tuvero.
